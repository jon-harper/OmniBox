# Trays/MCU

## Overview

MCU trays sit in the center of the main body and mount a micro-controller unit (MCU) board.

## M3/M4 Versions

Users of OmniBox before version 0.9.9 should use the M4 files. These are forward-compatible using M3 screws if you choose to upgrade later.

## Template Files

A template in both STEP and Fusion formats is available in the `Template` subfolder.
