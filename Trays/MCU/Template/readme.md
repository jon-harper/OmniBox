# Trays/MCU/Templates

## Overview

These are two sets of templates for mounting MCUs on a tray:

- New, M3 mounts
- Deprecated M4 mounts

Until 1.0, new boards should be issued with *both* mounting methods.

## Template Files

Templates are available in both STEP and Fusion formats. 

The Fusion files are identical save that the larger hole size is a suppressed feature in the M3 file.
