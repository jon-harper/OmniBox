A complete OmniBox made of parts from one release is tested to fit and work. Trays and panels are compatible with all releases (see Version Stability Guarantee for details). The Version History page contains information on the latest release, fixes, new features, and known issues. Version Stability Guarantee Printing OmniBox is an investment. The way trays and panels attach to OmniBox between versions is carefully fixed. The result is a modular case that can be upgraded piece by piece. Note Prior versions of this page had the Version Stability Guarantee fully in place. I have relaxed it until version 1.0 in order to deprecate M4-mounted parts. No reprinting is necessary to use legacy M4 panels with M3 screws. Currently Until version 1.0, it is still possible for changes to be made to the design of panels and trays. If this happens, parts using the old method are considered \"deprecated\". Deprecated parts remain available and supported through the release of 1.0 but will be removed after. Every effort is made to avoid incompatibilities between versions, and so far all deprecated printed parts remain compatible with new cases. Version 1.0 With version 1.0, changes may be made that cause deprecated parts to lose compatibility. This is a final chance to \"lock in\" the design. At this point, OmniBox releases will come with a Version Stability Guarantee : The way that Core components fit together and panels and trays attach to the case will be \"frozen\" and stable. If you choose to print a newer version of a Core part, no panels or trays will need to be reprinted. New products added in future releases can likewise be used in the Core case body from a prior release. Compatibility Example As an example, the design for CPU trays was modified for 0.9.9. Version 0.9.8-style trays are considered deprecated. The following shows how trays and Core cases and compatible with one another.

I printed my first of Steve Burcham's cases to remove my electronics from such heat (OmniBox is derived from his work). Managing Devices Common devices like fans and lights (and Raspberry Pis!) need a buck converter lower the voltage from a 3D printer's power supply. My printed cases for these printer/enclosure combos became cramped with them. Each buck converter had to sit on a tray above the microcontroller unit (MCU); wiring changes to the MCU required that I first remove up to three buck converter trays. Support for Large Boards Additionally, I wanted to use the BIGTREETECH's Octopus in a case, which I had used to success with another project. The Octopus 1.1 is a solid board that provides ample power sources and signal pins. The Octopus does not fit the cases I had already printed; I also had several ideas to improve upon Steve's case. With these requirements and goals in mind, I decided to design my own case. Building the OmniBox This is my second electronics case designed around general shape and layout from Steve's V3 case.

This page demonstrates: The core parts of OmniBox and their variations; Trays and panels; and How these pieces fit together. Overview A finished OmniBox. The configuration in the image above will be our example in this guide. We will start with the Core components and move on to the trays and panels that make OmniBox so modular. Links Links on this site to external resources have prefix icons to identify what they do: The git icon is used for links to the OmniBox GitHub. identifies an example link to a shopping site. Internal page links in this tour are marked with an arrow sign. Core Components Core components form the basis of every case. No end-user parts attach to core components. Instead, components are attached to trays and panels, which then mount on the Core case body. Important Most Core components come with the option of using heat set inserts for mounting commonly-removed panels and trays. These STL files have HSI in the name. The core components of an OmniBox with fans and power supply mounted. There are two types of Core components: Base and Main Body. A typical OmniBox build has two parts for the base and three for the main body. Base Front Rear Unified (replaces the above two) Main Body Crossbar Front Rear Base Base - Front This is the front of two base pieces that cover the power supply. There is a cutout for a 30mm x 11mm SPST switch in front, as well as air vents and optional 40mm fan mounts. Front Base - Rear The back covers the rest of the power supply and mounts a fused IEC power plug. This component is available with heat set inserts. Rear Base - Unified For owners of large-format printers, the base can be printed as a single piece instead of two. The unified base replaces the rear and front pieces. This component is available with heat set inserts. Unified Main Body Main Body - Crossbar This is a crossbar that joins and covers the joint between the lids and front display. Crossbar Main Body - Front The front half of the Main Body mounts the display and front panel. It also has a side air intake that comes in one of two configurations. This component is available with heat set inserts. Internal 40mm Fan External 60mm Fan This version has a side vent with an internal mount for a 40mm fan. This version requires the appropriate fan cage . Optionally, a TPU gasket can also be used with the fan cage. Front Main Body - Rear The rear half of the Main Body is the largest single piece of the case and operates with two levels. The lower level has CPU and lower bay trays. The upper level mounts the MCU. This component is available with heat set inserts. There are two variations of the rear main body: Dual 40mm Fans No Fan Mounts You will also need to print 40mm fan cages and (optionally) TPU gaskets for this variation. This versions of the rear main body requires either rear panel or lid-mounted fans. Rear Trays Trays are used for mounting parts internally. There are four (4) types of trays: The four types of trays in red. PSU Tray MCU Tray Lower Bay Trays CPU Tray Tray templates are available in both STEP and Fusion 360 format to add support for new products. PSU Tray Power supply (PSU) trays slide up from underneath the case. Large (tall) power supplies require the use of a base extension shim . PSU Supported PSUs MCU Tray MCU trays mount a microcontroller unit--your 3D printer board. MCU Supported MCUs Lower Bay Trays The lower bay is an area to mount parts like buck converters and MOSFETs. There are four dedicated lower bay trays locations and two more that can occupy an unused CPU tray bay. There are of these trays: Short and Long. A Long length tray covers the mount points of two Short trays and must be mounted from front to back of the case. Lower Bay Supported Lower Bay Components CPU Tray The CPU tray is an optional mount for a Raspberry Pi or other SoC. There are two bays for CPU trays; one is on each side of the case. An unused bay is replaced by a Side Panel . A short lower bay tray can also be installed in an unused CPU bay. CPU Supported SoC CPUs Panels The six types of panels. Front panel Display panel Lid Rear panel Side panel Bottom panel Panels cover the outside of OmniBox and mount of a range of options. Front, side, and rear panels are typically used for connectors, fans, and ventilation. There is a blank STEP and Fusion 360 template for each panel category to allow users to create new panels. Front Panel The front panel serves as an air vent and location to put a MicroSD card reader extension. USB extensions are also a common accessory. Front Panel Connector Panels Side Panel A side panel replaces a CPU tray and often mounts connectors or fans. A blank side panel can be used if necessary. Side Panel Connector Panels Bottom Panel The bottom panels act as a cover for the underside of the case. A fully enclosed option is available to keep dust out. Bottom Panel Display Panel This area mounts LCD displays, from the basic 128x64 character display to Raspbery Pi TFTs. Display Supported Displays Lid(s) The lid is both a way into your case and a configurable panel. There are two types of lids: short and long lids. You can either print one (1) long lid or two (2) short lids. See the README in the GitHub folder for a list of supported configurations. Lid Rear Panel The rear panel is used for ventilation, passing wiring out of your case, and optionally an additional fan. There are stock configurations available to suit common uses. A template is available for customization. Rear panels with panel mounted connectors are an active area of work. Rear Panel Connector Panels Other Components Several other components deserve mention in this tour; not all of these are 3D printed parts. Fans Base Extensions Power Switches IEC C14 Power Sockets Fans Externally mounted fans use fan cages to cover the fan blades. There are a large number of fan sizes supported, each with a matching TPU fan gasket. The gaskets are optional and serve to reduce noise. Internally mounted fans are also available, but are limited to 40mm fans. Fans Supported Fans Base Extensions Larger power supplies require the addition of a base extension shim. This mounts between the base and the bottom panel. Extension Shim Power Switch OmniBox uses a common 30x11mm snap-in SPST rocker switch to turn on and off. This is the same switch found on many 3D printers, particularly Creality.

This page covers: An overview of what to expect; Accounting for differences in configuration from this guide; and Best practices during assembly. Version Note Instructions in this Guide are for Release 0.9.9 . Details may differ for older or newer versions of OmniBox. Table of Contents The OmniBox Assembly Guide is divided into four main sections: 1. Heat Set Inserts (HSI) This section introduces HSIs, using them, and installing them in the case. Skip this section if you did not print an HSI case. 2. Core & PSU Assembly starts by building the Base around the PSU tray. This acts as a first layer of the case that we will build upwards from. 3. CPU & Lower Bay Trays The second layer of the case adds the SoC CPU and lower bay components. By the end of this section, the \"floor\" of the case and front panel will be installed. 4. MCU & Panels At this point, assembly centers around the MCU, wiring, and closing up the case. Format Each section of assembly guide has four parts: A short (5-15 second) video overview of the section; A materials list; Step-by-step instructions; and A final reference image. Most graphics can be enlarged to see detail. Time Most of the case can be assembled in approximately two (2) hours. This estimate assumes that you: Have printed all necessary parts ; and Have never assembled an OmniBox. This estimate does not include: Heat set insert (HSI) installation, if applicable; Time needed for wiring; and Power up & testing. Configurations These instructions are for a generic OmniBox configuration with at least one of every type of tray, panel, or fan mounting. Details may differ from your build, but the common aspects of assembly are covered. For example, the size, location, and number of fans in your configuration may vary, but the methods of mounting both internal and external fans are covered. Areas where the Core variants may differ from instructions are specifically called out. Techniques Assembly relies on a few general techniques reused throughout this guide. Fastening Screws Screws thread directly into the walls of the printed plastic (where heat set inserts are not used). For example, lower bay trays attach to the main body with M3 screws. The trays have holes larger than the diameter of the screw, but the holes in the standoff are smaller. The screw \"bites\" the plastic of the standoff and the screw head to clamps down on the tray. Note Parts of the case that are frequently removed have deeper-than-necessary screw holes. You can use replace your screws with longer ones to get \"fresh\" plastic for the threads as the walls wear down. For example, over time you may need to switch from 8mm to 10mm screws. This is most common with the lid, as it is removed most often. Example Illustrations Illustrations for assembly are provided from isometric (angled and over-or-under) perspectives. The relevant parts for the current step are highlighted in each illustration. Materials Lists Tabbed lists are used in this guide for materials lists in most sections. This separates materials used in the example from a generic list common to every build. It is also used where materials required are different for stock and HSI cases. Printed parts are always notated. For example, from the display panel section: As Illustrated Stock HSI Parts Qty Note M3 x 6mm machine screws 4 M3 x 8mm machine screws 4 May substitute 10mm or 12mm.

Time Installation time varies by experience; typically this is between 15 to 45 minutes. Additional Materials Soldering iron M3 heat set insert tip for soldering irons Needle-nosed pliers or fine tweezers Practice Block If you are using inserts for the first time, print at least one practice block . Experience with inserts saves time and lowers the chances of printed part damage. These blocks have holes in two orientations: flat and set at a 50 degree angle. The holes are identical in shape to those used in the case. Practice putting inserts in both types of holes until comfortable with the procedure. Procedure Setup Install the M3 insert tip on your soldering iron. Pre-heat the iron to a low temperature (200C is fine for both PLA and PETG). Allow enough time for your iron to heat up. A 40W iron may need two minutes. Installation Note These inserts have a rounded lip on one side. This end \"sits\" in the hole and maintains alignment with the hole during heating and insertion. Tip The insert holes have a slight inward slope. Resistance will gradually increase as the insert slides in place. Resistance greatly increases when the insert deviates from the hole. Caution Insertion of an insert leaves both the insert and surrounding plastic hot for several minutes. Avoid touching areas of the case around an insert until it has cooled. Pre-set an insert into the hole using your fingers or needle-nosed pliers. It drop in until it reaches the first set of knurles (or pop in place with some pressure). Place the tip of the soldering iron on the insert. Do not apply pressure yet. As the insert heats, it will soften the plastic around it. Apply gentle pressure with the iron. Let the shape of the hole guide the insert. Once the insert is flush or slightly below the surface, remove the iron. Check if the insert is off-center by looking for gaps around the edges. The plastic should be evenly melted around the insert. If the insert needs adjustment, gently use needle-nosed pliers or tweezers to straighten it (while still hot). See below if it the insert cools. Fixing a Cooled Insert Sometimes an off-center insert is not discovered until later. The most common symptom is a squealing noise when inserting screws. If this happens, stop assembly to fix the insert. Note These instructions are still being fine-tuned. Preheat the soldering iron to a low temperature, as before. Set the iron's tip on the insert, but do not press down . Allow roughtly three (3) seconds for the insert to heat. Gently tilt the soldering iron to straighten the insert in the hole. Do not press hard; wait for the plastic to soften instead. Once the insert is upright, remove the iron.

Note that this view is from the bottom up; the line (L) wire is the red wire on bottom. 2. Attach one end of the wire with two spade connectors to the socket's line (L) terminal. 3. Run the wire through the PSU tray's wiring hole and attach it to either terminal on the power switch. 4. Attach the spade connector on the remaining wire to the remaining free switch terminal. 5. Run the wire back through the PSU tray's wiring hole and secure the fork terminal to the PSU's line (L) AC terminal.

Label connectors with where they attach to the MCU board for easy removal and reconnection later (e.g., TB for the bed thermistor header). Check connector pins: Many connector pins are not designed for frequent removal: wires may pull free from the pin or pin from the connector. Pin can become damaged or come loose during removal. JST XH connectors are particularly prone to pin issues (usually used for fans, thermistors, and endstops). Zip tie anchors: The zip tie anchors in the sides of the case are helpful for securing longer wires. If you are crimping your own wires, extra length can be used to keep the wiring clean.
