I printed my first of Steve's cases to remove my electronics from such heat. Managing Devices Most common devices like fans and lights (and Raspberry Pis!) need a buck converter to work with a 3D printer's power supply. My printed cases for these printer/enclosure combos became cramped. Each buck converter had to sit on a tray above the microcontroller unit (MCU); wiring changes to the MCU required that I first remove up to three buck converter trays. Support for Large Boards Additionally, I wanted to use the BIGTREETECH's Octopus in a case, which I had used to success with another project. The Octopus 1.1 is a solid board that provides ample power sources and signal pins. The Octopus does not fit the cases I had already printed; I also had several ideas to improve upon Steve's case. With these requirements and goals in mind, I decided to design my own case. Building the OmniBox This is my second electronics case for the Octopus designed around general shape and layout from Steve's V3 case. I kept full compatibility only with the original display screens. Lids should be easy to modify to fit. Templates are provided for all trays and panels to allow further customization and support for new products.

Areas where the Core parts may differ from instructions are specifically called out.","title":"Configurations"},{"location":"assembly/core/","text":"Base You will need: Parts Qty Note M4 x 16mm machine screws 4 Can substitute with M4 x 20mm M3 x 16mm machine screws 2 Can substitute with M3 x 20mm M3 hex nuts 2 SPST toggle switch 1 IEC C14 socket with fuse 1 Base - Front 1 Base - Front.stl Base - Rear 1 Base - Rear.stl Directions: Step Example Both front and rear halves of the base have two (2) holes on each side.

Push the power switch into the cutout in the front of the base. The sides of the switch will compress until it snaps into place. Insert the IEC socket into the rear base, followed by the M3 x 16mm screws. There are two pockets for hex nuts opposing the M3 screws. One hex nut at a time, press a nut in place while turning the opposing screw. Once the threads of the screw catch the nut, continue threading until the nut is tight. There is a 40mm fan mount behind one of the front air vents. If you wish to use a 40mm fan there, install it now with four (4) M3 x 16mm machine screws. Now is a good time to run the AC wiring for the power supply. Zip tie anchors are available for the wire run from socket to switch and back to power supply. Base Extensions If you are installing the base extensions (needed for the RSP-500 power supply), follow the next steps. If not, skip down to the Main Body section . You will need: Parts Qty Note M3 x 8mm machine screws 4 Any length up to 20mm will work.

Main Body - Crossbar 1 Main Body - Crossbar A power supply unit (PSU) 1 Notes and Cautions: Note Sharp point screws are easier to use than machine scews for attaching the main body and base. For this you can use #6 x 3/4\" screws (SAE) or M3 equivalent screws found at any hardware store. If these are not convenient or available, M3 machine screws will work in their place. Caution Always stop if you feel resistance when fastening screws to the power supply. Screws longer than 8mm may touch components in the power supply and short or damage them. Most models have no extra cleareance for overtightening if 8mm machine screws are used; thus we advice 6mm for safety. Directions: Step Example Using six (6) M3 x 8mm screws, add a screw at a time to fasten the rear body to the front. Alternate sides with each screw. Note : Insert the screws from the back to the front of the case. Here we have all six screws inserted. Line up the holes on the top of the power supply with the main body. The holes pointed at in the picture need to align. Mount the power supply using four (4) M4 x 8mm screws. Place the assembled main body on top of the base. Using your long machine or sharp point screws, partially thread one screw near one of the rear corners and an opposing front corner. Continue adding screws on alternating sides until all eight (8) screws are partially threaded, then tighten them all. Place the crossbar in place at the joint between the lid and display mounts. Take note of the orientation in the picture. Attach the crossbar with two (2) M3 x 16mm screws, one in each side. Fans Fan locations and sizes vary by configuration. This section is specific to the configuration assembled in this guide. The length of screws needed and printed parts will vary, but the method of mounting fans used here is identical for all sizes of externally mounted fans.

Each section starts with a list of the universal requirements for attaching that type of panel. Additional parts needed for the specific variation used are listed separately. Front Panel You will need at least: Parts Qty Note Front panel 1 Printed M3 x 8mm machine screws 2 All front panels mount using two (2) of these. In this example, we will also use: Parts Qty Note Front Panel - Micro SD Extension with USB C.stl 1 Printed LANMU MicroSD Holder Body.stl 1 Printed LANMU MicroSD Holder Cap.stl 1 Printed Micro SD card extension 1 USB C panel mount extension 1 M3 x 6mm machine screws 2 M3 x 8mm machine screws 2 Step Example The USB C panel mount comes with screws and attaches directly. Carefully remove the outer shell from the Micro SD card extension. Place the reader PCB into the shell, as in the picture. Put the shell lid on and attach with two (2) M3 x 6mm screws. Insert the extension shell into the front panel and attach with two (2) M3 x 8mm screws. Orientation up or down does not matter. Push the panel into place on the main body. Fasten the panel with two (2) M3 x 8mm screws. Rear Panel You will need at least: Parts Qty Note Rear panel 1 Printed M4 x 8mm machine screws 8 All rear panels mount using eight (8) of these. Our rear panel in this example is a panel mount test piece, but all rear panels follow the same pattern. Some rear panels may have a fan to mount. If you are using the rear panel to mount connectors, it is strongly advised that you insert the connectors before installing the panel or connecting any wires to the board. Step Example Push the rear panel in place against the back of the case. You may need to guide the wires out of the way. Attach the panel using eight (8) M4 screws. Remaining Wiring It's a good idea to attach all remaining wiring before we close up the case further. Display Panel You will need at least: Parts Qty Note Display panel 1 Printed LCD or TFT display 1 M4 x 12mm machine screws 4 All display screen panels mount using four (4) of these. For this example, we will also use: Parts Qty Note Generic 12864 Display Mount 1 Printed Creality 12864 display 1 LCD display example M3 x 6mm machine screws 4 Note Some display mounts have more than one piece and require additional screws. The below is an example with a stock Creality 12864 display. Step Example Remove the knob on the display screen. It should pull off. Slide the screen into place on the mount and fasten with four (4) M3 x 6mm screws. Re-attach the knob to the display screen. Again, it should slide into place with light force. If your display mount has multiple pieces, attach those now (usually only applies to displays with side-mount SD card readers). Insert the display connectors and slide the cables in before the display. Fasten the display panel with four (4) M4 x 12mm screws. Lid(s) Like the rear panel, the lid is intended for customization. The below is an example for a simple lid with a handle. You will need for any lid or pair of half-lids: Parts Qty Note M3 x 8mm machine screws 8 See note below. Lid 1 Printed In this example, we also use: Parts Qty Note M3 x 8mm machine screws 2 Carry handle 1 Printed Carry handle lid 1 Printed Note 0.9.8 introduces half-length lids.

Note Because the screws are threaded directly into plastic, removing and reattaching the lid will eventually wear out the holes in the main body. I recommend starting with shorter (8mm) screws and gradually switching to longer ones over time to get \"fresh\" plastic. Lids may use screws up to 16mm in length.
