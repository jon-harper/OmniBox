A finished OmniBox is an investment that can grow with your needs. The Core case is designed for flexibility and reuse, and every effort is made to avoid incompatibilities between versions.

## Core Compatibility

Upgrading an OmniBox is typically done by upgrading the Main Body and retaining an old Base.

### v0.9.8.1 and Earlier

Releases prior to v0.9.9 cannot be partially upgraded and are considered deprecated.

### v0.9.9

The Base is freely compatible with v0.9.10's Main Body. v0.9.11 is compatible aside from cosmetic differences.

### v0.9.10

v0.9.10 is compatible with v0.9.11 aside from cosmetic differences between Main Body and Base.

## Tray and Panel Compatibility

See the [Templates][templates] page for details.
