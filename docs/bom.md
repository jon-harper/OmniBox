The Universal Bill of Materials is a base list common to all builds. Additional components based on your build configuration are listed separately.

- There are no affiliate links used on this site.
- The :material-cart: shopping cart icon indicates an external link to a shopping website.
- These links are not an endorsement and for reference only.
- The design allows for longer-than-specified screws in certain locations. The [assembly guide][assembly] notes where substitutions can be made.
- Wiring is only specified for the IEC power socket, power switch, and power supply. Additional wiring and fusing considerations are configuration-specific.

## Universal Bill of Materials

These parts are common to all case builds. See below for additional requirements based on configuration.

!!! note "Note: Glass Fuses"
    Socket fuses do *not* replace the fuses on your board or inline fuses.

    Users will typically want to fuse with fast or medium blow fuses on the socket. Determining the correct fuse for a given configuration is beyond the scope of this documentation. The Oznium blog has an [excellent guide][fuse_guide] on choosing a fuse size.

!!! note "Note: Wiring and Connectors"
    This list is not all-encompassing for wiring. Additional connectors and wiring may be needed, including for [grounding your bed/frame to earth][ground_guide].

### Fasteners

Cases with heat set inserts use shorter fasteners in some locations. Use the Stock list if you are not printing a case with inserts.

OmniBox is compatible with both socket head and button head cap screws. All links are to socket head screws, where applicable.

    Additionally, you will need an [:material-cart: M3 soldering iron tip for heat set inserts][bom_hsi_tips].

!!! note "Note: Sharp Point Wood Screws"
    To substitute #6 x 3/4" with Metric screws, use M3 x 16mm or M3 x 20mm. Equivalent length machine screws can also be used if sharp point screws are unavailable.

!!! note "Heat Set Inserts"
    M3 x 4.6mm outer diameter inserts will be replaced in future releases with the more common "Voron-style" inserts that are M3 x 5mm outer diameter and 4mm in length.
    
    User mods that require inserts universally use the Voron-style inserts.

### MicroSD Reader Extensions

Each MCU tray entry has a field for whether a short or long MicroSD card reader extension is necessary (if using one for the front panel).

- Short: [:material-cart: LANMU MicroSD Card Reader Extension][bom_lanmu_micro_sd]
- Long: [:material-cart: ELECTOP MicroSD Card Reader Extension][bom_electop_micro_sd]

## Core Configurations with Fans

Most Core component configurations mount at least one fan. The materials necessary are specified below.

### Base - Front

The base can mount up to three concealed 40mm fans in the intakes. The following are needed to mount *each* fan:

| Item                              | Qty | UOM | Note                                                     |

| [:material-cart: M3 x 16mm machine screws][bom_m3_16] | 4   | ea	| Some fans have recesses that instead use 10-12mm screws. |

### Main Body - Front

There are two versions of the front main body.

=== "Internal 40mm Intake"

    [![illustration][img_front_40mm]{ width="300" }][img_front_40mm]

    This version of the front main body has an optional 40mm fan.

    | Item                              | Qty | UOM | Note                                                     |

    | [:material-cart: M3 x 16mm machine screws][bom_m3_16] | 4   | ea	| Some fans have recesses that instead use 10-12mm screws. |

=== "External 60mm Intake"

    [![illustration][img_front_60mm]{ width="300" }][img_front_60mm]

    This version of the front main body requires an externally mounted 60mm fan.

    | Item                              | Qty | UOM | Note                                                     |
    |-----------------------------------|-----|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | [:material-cart: 60x60x15mm axial fan][bom_6015] | 1   | ea  | May also use 20mm or 25mm thick fans.     |
    | [:material-cart: M4 x 25mm machine screws][bom_m4_25]          | 4   | ea  | Add 10mm to fan depth for thicker fans.                  |
    | [:material-git: Fan Cage][git_fans] | 1   | ea  | :material-printer-3d-nozzle: Printed.                  |
    | [:material-git: Fan Gasket][git_fans] | 1   | ea  | :material-printer-3d-nozzle: Printed TPU. Optional.  |

### Main Body - Rear

The rear body also has two versions: one with dual exhausts and one without any.

=== "Dual 40mm Exhausts"

    [![illustration][img_rear_dual_40mm]{ width="300" }][img_rear_dual_40mm]

    This version adds two (2) externally mounted 40mm fans.

    | Item                              | Qty | UOM | Note                                                     |
    |-----------------------------------|-----|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | [:material-cart: 40x40x10mm axial fans][bom_4010] | 2   | ea  |                                          |
    | [:material-cart: M3 x 20mm machine screws][bom_m3_20]  | 8   | ea	| Use 30mm screws for 20mm fans (not recommended).         |

=== "No Exhaust Fans"

    [![illustration][img_rear_no_fans]{ width="300" }][img_rear_no_fans]

    There are no additional materials required for this version. 

    !!! important
        This rear main body must be used with a rear panel or lid that provides an exhaust fan.

## Tray and Panel Configurations

The Universal Bill of Materials includes the fasteners needed to mount panels and the the required trays. It does *not* include the hardware needed to attach anything to those panels and trays.

The [Supported Parts Overview][support] has a full list of parts and mounting locations. Some configurations require additional fasteners or fans.

### PSU Trays

Power supplies are notable for mounting to the tray with M4 x 6mm screws. See the [list of supported PSUs][psu] for quantities.

### Lower Bay Trays

Each tray (short or long) uses four (4) M3 x 6mm screws to mount the tray. Additional materials are listed on the [Lower Bay Components][lower_bay] page.

### Panel Mounted Parts

Panel mounts are a way of providing external connectors to internal parts, such as the MCU or CPU board USB ports. The [Panel Mounts][panel_mount] page discusses this in more detail.
