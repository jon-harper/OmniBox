OmniBox mounts parts on a set of internal trays and external panels. This section documents the products supported by these and includes a bill of materials, as needed.

## Fit Testing

Before a tray or panel is merged into the `main` or another stable branch, it has to be fit tested. Parts that have not been tested for fit are marked:

!!! caution "Fit Test Pending: Issue #NNN"

If you print one of these parts, please report your results! There is usually an open [:material-git: issue on GitHub][git_issues] for that hardware component.

## Trays

Trays mount most of the key hardware in your case.

- [MCU Trays][mcu] lists supported MCU boards.
- [CPU Trays][cpu] replace side panels and mount SBCs.
- [PSU Trays][psu] mount power supplies under the case.
- [Lower Bay Trays][lower_bay] lists supported accessories, such as buck converters and solid state relays.

## Panels

### Display Screen Panels

[Display Panels][displays] are used for LCD displays, including Raspberry Pi TFTs. A blank template is available for users without a display.

### Front, Side, and Rear Panels

These panels are typically used for [panel mounted connectors and extensions][panel_mounts] and mounting [fans][fans].

Generic rear panels are available with cutouts to pass wiring directly without using connectors.

## Fans

An assortment of fans are supported and include cages and optional TPU shims. See the [Fans][fans] page for a full list.

The front and rear main bodies come in versions with and without fans. The rear panel and lid can also be used for mounting fans.
