## MCU Wiring

Before we install the lid, all remaining wiring for the MCU and any other components should be completed. The combinations of MCUs and printers (and their types of wiring harnesses!) is too large to fit this guide. Below are tips and links to other resources. This section will grow with time.

### Safety 

- Double-check your work.
- Be prepared to cut power instantly during both power on and testing the printer.
- **Consider safing your printer against ground faults!**
    - Grounding to earth protects in case of a number of issues, e.g., a short in the bed touching the frame.
    - This is very important for AC-powered beds.
    - Connect your frame to the AC ground (usually a yellow or green wire, **not** the black neutral wire).
    - Do not assume your power supply case is safely earthedâ€”test with a multimeter.
    - [TH3D has a page with helpful videos on the subject][ground_guide].

### General Tips

- Double-check your work as you go.
- Label connectors with where they attach to the MCU board for easy removal and reconnection later (e.g., `TB` for the bed thermistor header).
- Check connector pins:
    - Many connector pins are not designed for frequent removal: wires may pull free from the pin or pin from the connector.
    - Pin can become damaged or come loose during removal.
    - JST XH connectors are particularly prone to pin issues (usually used for fans, thermistors, and endstops).
- Zip tie anchors:
    - The zip tie anchors in the sides of the case are helpful for securing longer wires.
    - If you are crimping your own wires, extra length can be used to keep the wiring clean.

!!! tip "Before Continuing"
    It is a good idea to perform initial power on tests now.
