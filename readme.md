## CAUTION

This is a **beta** branch!

You've been warned.

-------

Welcome to the OmniBox repository! OmniBox is a modular, 3D printed electronics case for controlling 3D printers. It is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's **[Stand Alone Main Control Case](https://github.com/bgdog1/3dPrinterCase)** V3.

This project focuses on modularity, accessibility to users, and reusability. The goal of OmniBox is to make your printer's electronics as valuable and re-usable an asset as the printer it controls.

## Documentation & Help

The **[documentation](https://jon-harper.github.io/OmniBox)** includes a visual tour, a full bill of materials, list of supported parts, and guides for both printing and assembly.

Drop by the **[OmniBox Discord server](https://discord.gg/nKmJZMhfz5)** if you have other questions.
