Welcome to the OmniBox repository! OmniBox is a modular, 3D printed electronics case for controlling 3D printers. It is conceptually derived from Steve Burcham's **[Stand Alone Main Control Case](https://github.com/bgdog1/3dPrinterCase)** V3.

This project focuses on modularity, accessibility to users, and reusability. The goal of OmniBox is to make your printer's electronics as valuable and re-usable an asset as the printer it controls.

## Documentation & Help

The **[Documentation][latest_docs]** includes a visual tour, a full bill of materials, list of supported parts, and guides for both printing and assembly.
