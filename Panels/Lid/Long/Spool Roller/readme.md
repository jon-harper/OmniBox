# Spool Roller Lid

The STL files in this folder are for a lid that doubles as a platform/mount for a spool roller.

This lid is based on my [Tighter T.U.S.H.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4737072) filament roller project on Thingiverse.

This component was introduced in version 0.9.8.1.

## Bill of Materials

| Item | Qty |
|------|-----|
| `Lid - Spool Roller.stl` | 1 ea |
| `Spool Roller.stl`       | 4 ea |
| M3 x 16mm machine screws | 4 ea |
| 608ZZ ball bearings      | 4 ea |

## Instructions

1. Print one (1) of the lid file and four (4) of the spool roller files.
2. Set a spool roller flat in front of you.
3. There are two standoffs in on each side of the spool roller, both with holes in them. Set a 608ZZ ball bearing on each one.
4. The standoffs should go halfway up the center of the ball bearings. Take another spool holder and place it face down so that the standoffs meet in the ball bearing.
5. Insert an M3 screw in the left hole (the larger one) and screw it tight.
6. Flip the assembly over and insert an M3 screw in the left (larger) hole and tighten.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 to make another spool roller.
8. Snap the rollers onto the lid guide and adjust the distance between the rollers for brand of filament.
